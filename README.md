[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)


In this project, the goal is to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video.
The project writeup is in `project_writeup.md`.
Relevant files that support the writeup (like source code and video output) are `vehicle_detection.ipynb`, `utilities.py`, and the `project_video_result.mp4` video.
