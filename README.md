# Vehicle Detection
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)


In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4), but the main output or product we want you to create is a detailed writeup of the project.  Check out the [writeup template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/writeup_template.md) for this project and use it as a starting point for creating your own writeup.  

The project writeup is in `project_writeup.md`.
Relevant files that support the writeup (like source code and video output) are `vehicle_detection.ipynb`, `utilities.py`, and the `project_video_result.mp4` video.
